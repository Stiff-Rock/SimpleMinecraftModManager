# SimpleModManager

## What's This?
This is a small Electron project for downloading Minecraft mods and managing your mods folder. My focus is to provide a simple interface for those who don't want to use third-party launchers but still prefer not to manage mod downloading manually. I'm doing everything by myself for now since this is just a casual project to learn and have fun. 

## How Does It Work?
It runs by utilizing the Modrinth API and my little Electron and JavaScript/Node.js knowledge. It is really not usable at the moment, the UI is provisional and the features below are not really working or even implemented.

## Short-Term Features
- **Mod Downloading with automatic dependency matching**
- **Mod Folder Management**

## Long-Term Features
- **Create Profiles**
- **Shaders and Texture Packs downloading and management**

## Build
Currently, there is no build of the app available, and I do not plan to create one in the long term, not until the app works properly. However, if you still want to try it, you can run it in your IDE (I use VSCode, but any IDE will work) or build it yourself. **Just make sure you have set up a Node.js project, as I do not include the node_modules.**

### To Clone the Repository:
